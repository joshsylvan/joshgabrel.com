    <h1>Musical Estate Agent</h1>
    <p>
      In 2019 I took part in global Game Jam 2019. A group of five of us created
      the Musical Estate Agent.

      Players all log onto a web app and one of them is randomly selected to be
      the conductor. The conductor is responsible for organising everyone else
      into 3 groups of musicians. Each group has an instrument to play on their
      devices and the conductor points to each group when it is their turn to
      play. The more in time everyone is, the symphony will sound better.

    <p>The group that sounds the best, sells the most houses.</p>

      Client web app was created with React, the game server was created with
      Node.js and the host game viewer with Unity.
