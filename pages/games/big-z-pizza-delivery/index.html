    <h1>Big Z's Pizza Delivery</h1>
    <p>
      This year (2025) I finally finished a small 2D game engine. After a while
      learning some C++ I finally have a "finished" prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Big Z's Pizza Delivery</strong>, is a tiny platformer about
      delivering Pizza's, paying rent and defeating your langlord.

    <p>
      After a few Handmade Hero episodes and watching some CMake tutorials I
      made a prototype of my game engine!
    </p>
    <h2>Nerd stuff</h2>
    <p>Built with C++, CMake, OpenGL, OpenAL, ImGui and SDL3.</p>

    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The project is split into <i>core</i> (static lib),
      <i>src</i> (executable), and <i>pizza_delivery</i> (dll / static lib in
      release).
    </p>
    <p>
      Core contains shared functions for the "engine" and game. It is statically
      linked into the executable and pizza_delivery library.
    </p>
    <p>
      pizza_delivery contains the game update and render functions. This is
      built as a standalone library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The src directory contains the main application executable. In debug mode
      the application will load in the pizza_game library dynamically. If the
      game library code is updated while the executable is running, the game
      library is hot reloaded.
