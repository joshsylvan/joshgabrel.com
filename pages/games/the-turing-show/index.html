      Disclaimer I am very anti-AI for in general for commercial games. This was
      a game jam project to explore what we could do with some APIs. Game was
      not deployed anywhere as I think it is unethical to deploy apps like this.

      In the turing show a human will have to blend into a generated TV sitcom.
      The human will have to improvise lines in a fully voiced AI generated tv
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      One human 'the writer' will have to write lines and blend in to the
      current scene. The others, 'the viewers' will have to guess which charater
      in the show is human.
