    <h1>Murder With Friends</h1>
    <p>
      In 2018 I took part in the Global Game Jam in Brighton. In a group of five
      people, we created a game called 'Murder With Friends' in 48 hours.

    <p>
      A game about pitching friends against each other, having one player stuck
      in a creepy dungeon and the other controlling the environment. The goal of
      the first player is to survive waves of monsters using a pistol or shotgun
      while also avoiding traps. The other player can unleash monsters in
      different rooms and activate the traps that will hurt the player.

    <p>
      The game had lots of moving parts that we had to make functional for the
      demo.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The core game was made in Unity.</li>
      <li>
        The Web App for activating traps and monsters was built with React and
        Redux.
      </li>
      <li>
        A small heroku server to send requests from the web app to the game
        using web sockets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Art. As none of us were artists we all contributed to some pixel art
        assets.
      </li>
    </ul>
