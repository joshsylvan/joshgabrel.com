    <h1>Fight Twitter</h1>
    <p>
      Fight Twitter is a game created by
      <a target="_blank" href="https://lucasrijllart.com/"> Lucas Rijllart.</a>
      and myself during a 12 hour hackathon at the University of Sussex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intention was to have two users enter their twitter handles and make
      their profiles fight to the death. To do this we download their profile
      pictures and put them onto their characters. We wanted to add quotes from
      their tweets as they fight, but could not complete this within the 12
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Source code is avliable but does not work any more. It uses an old version
      of the Twitter (RIP) API from 8 years ago.
